      "Bot: The Sri Rangam Temple is a truly unique and spiritual experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's switch gears to something entirely different â€“ GitHub! Here are 5 useful GitHub commands:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. `git status`**\n",
      "\n",
      "This command checks the status of your local repository. It tells you if there are any changes made to the files that need to be committed or pushed to GitHub.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "$ git status\n",
      "```\n",
      "**2. `git add .`**\n",
      "\n",
      "This command stages all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories, preparing them for a commit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "$ git add .\n",
      "```\n",
      "**3. `git log --oneline`**\n",
      "\n",
      "This command shows you a condensed version of your commit history, with each commit represented by a single line that includes the commit hash, author name, email, and commit message.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "$ git log --oneline\n",
      "```\n",
      "**4. `git branch -a`**\n",
      "\n",
      "This command lists all local branches in your repository, including the current one (usually marked with an asterisk \\*).\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "$ git branch -a\n",
      "```\n",
      "**5. `git remote -v`**\n",
      "\n",
      "This command shows you the URLs of the repositories that are tracked by your local repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "$ git remote -v\n",
      "origin  https://github.com/username/repository.git (fetch)\n",
      "origin  https://github.com/username/repository.git (push)\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "You: how to pull the folder from the git repository?\n",
      "Bot: To pull a folder (or a specific branch) from a Git repository, you can use the following command:\n",
      "\n",
      "**`git clone <repository-url>`**\n",
      "\n",
      "This will create a local copy of the entire repository on your machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you want to clone only a specific folder or branch, you'll need to specify it in the URL. Let's assume the repository URL is:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "https://github.com/username/repository.git\n",
      "```\n",
      "To pull the `feature/new-feature` branch and its contents:\n",
      "\n",
      "**`git clone -b feature/new-feature https://github.com/username/repository.git`**\n",
      "\n",
      "This will create a local copy of the `feature/new-feature` branch within the repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to fetch only the specific folder (e.g., `src/my-folder`) without cloning the entire repository, use the following command:\n",
      "\n",
      "**`git clone --sparse https://github.com/username/repository.git`**\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, navigate into the cloned repository and run:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "$ git sparse-checkout set src/my-folder/\n",
      "$ git add .\n",
      "$ git commit -m \"Checkout only my-folder\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "This will fetch only the `src/my-folder` directory from the repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important note:** The `--sparse` option is available in Git 2.13 and later versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "For older Git versions, you can use:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "$ git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git\n",
      "$ cd repository\n",
      "$ git checkout feature/new-feature -- src/my-folder/\n",
